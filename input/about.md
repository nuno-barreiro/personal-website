Hi, my name is Nuno Barreiro. 

I'm a programmer, consultant, blogger, technologist and enthusiast gamer. I've worked for many companies throughout the years which allowed me to gain a lot of experience in multiple business areas. I also like to write and to share my knowledge and experience and so I started this blog. 

If you want to follow my latest updates please subscribe to my blog's [RSS feed](feed.rss), or you can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nuno_barreiro) or reach out via [LinkedIn](https://ww.linkedin.com/in/nunobarreiro/).

All the content and opinions on this site are my own.
